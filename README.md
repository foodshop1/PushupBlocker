# PushBlock
Winner of best healthcare hack for GenAI 2025 (virtual)

NOTE: As of right now we have not uploaded this as an official extention on the chrome web store and is in its beta stages. (you can still run this as an extention)

To run this code:
- First make sure to download all of the files in its respected directory
- First run the pushup_counter.py file to initiate the flask server
- Go on chrome://extensions/ and on the top right corner enable "developer mode"
- Click "Load unpressed" and make sure to select the push-up-blocker-extention directory
Enjoy!
